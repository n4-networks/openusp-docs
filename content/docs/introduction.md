# Introduction 

**USP** stands for the User Services Platform, a standardized platform to **manage**, **monitor**, **update**, and **control** connected devices, services, IoT, and home networks. USP consists of an **architecture**, **protocol**, and set of **data models** that create a network of Controllers and Agents that allow applications to manipulate the hardware and software capabilities of an end-userâ€™s network and devices (network interfaces, consumer electronics platforms, smart objects, virtualized network functions, etc.).

It has been standarized by [Broadband Forum](https://www.broadband-forum.org/) and published at [USP](https://usp.technology).

User Service Platform has been evolved from one of the most successful remote managment and provisioning protocol called [TR-069](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069). Over a billion devices are using TR-069 across the globe by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Device Manufacturers.

TR-369/USP fills up some of the gaps identified on TR-69 (CWMP):

 - Multiple management server support
 - Use case driven message transfer protocols
 - Efficient data encoding
 - Always-on communication
 - Application layer security
 - Distributed data model processing - crucial for big data and IoT applications

# What is OpenUSP?

**OpenUSP** is an open source implementation of USP having following platform components:
1. Controller
2. Database
3. API Service
4. Command Line Interface (CLI)
5. GUI (Graphical User Initerface)
